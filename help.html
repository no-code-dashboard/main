        <summary>What is No-code-dashboard App?</summary>
        <p>
          No-code-Dashboard App (NCD App) is an easily configurable app that
          lets you speedily implement of a professional quality dashboard for
          your projects without any fuss.
        </p>
        <p>
          The App is based on years of experience of successfully building
          dashboards to support many different projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first dashboard is built in seconds by just loading data. The
          dashboard can then be easily configured. The App does not any require
          specialist skills, equipment or software other than an internet
          connection and the App. It allows the data held in the collaborative
          tools (such as Jira, DevOps, Service Now, HP/QC, and good old excel)
          to be the single source of truth. All stakeholders from execs to PMs
          to developers/testers use same data to make decisions.
        </p>

      <details>
        <summary>How to use the App?</summary>

        <p>
          The main menu on the top of the screen shows the options available.
        </p>
        <p>In non demo mode the options are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>TOC</b> shows a table-of-content</li>
          <li>
            <b>Load Data</b> allows you to load fresh data. When data is loaded
            first time a config created automatically. You can modify these
            configs as described in the following sections. The input data is
            expected as a csv (comma separated value) file. The App expects the
            date fields to be in DD-MMM-YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD format. This is to
            avoid misinterpreting American and European date formats.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Modify Layout</b> lets you update the chart title of the
            <em>data as of date</em>. This is the <em>report date</em> which is
            used in other charts (W4, Trend and Trend OC),
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Download Main Config</b> allows you to download the current
            config. You can use the file later. For some reason the download is
            not working consistently in all browsers. It download is
            unsuccessful the config is copied to clipboard and the workaround is
            to open a new text file, paste the config and save the file
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Upload Main Config</b> allows you to load (a previously saved)
            config. In this way you save time when re-configuring charts when
            data is refreshed.
          </li>
          <li><b>Print PDF</b> creates a PDF version of the dashboard.</li>
          <li><b>Help</b> shows you this page</li>
          <li><b>Feedback</b> lets you to send an email with your comments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In demo mode a list of predefined options are shown between
          <b>TOC</b> and <b>Print PDF</b>
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What is a Chart menu?</summary>

        <p>
          On the top-right corner of every chart there is a
          <em>hamburger menu</em>. When you click on this the App will offer
          following options:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Filter Chart</b> shows all the values in the x-axis where you can
            select the values that you want filtered: check to show and uncheck
            to hide. Note this option is only shown for the charts that are
            filterable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Config Chart</b> gives you the option to change the chart as you
            see fit.This is described in detail in a separate section.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Remove Chart</b> deletes the chart. The App asks for a
            confirmation from you before deleting chart
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Clone Chart</b> lets you add a copy of the chart at the current
            position. Once copied you can change the config.
          </li>
          <li><b>Close</b> closes the dialogue.</li>
        </ul>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How to configure charts?</summary>
        <p>
          When new data is loaded the App creates a config automatically based
          on inferred data types. These can be changed using
          <b>Config chart</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some common values for all charts; these are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Chart title</b> lets you change the title of a chart.",</li>
          <li>
            <b>Auto title</b> indicates if the title should be automatically set
            by the App. It is recommended that you keep this checked while you
            are configuring the charts. Once you are done, you can uncheck this
            option and enter your value.",
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Chart size</b> can be small, medium or large. On larger screens,
            such as PC or laptop, the three types will show appropriately. On a
            smaller screen, such as mobile, all charts will show in one size.",
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Chart position</b> lets you re-position a chart. Select a new
            position and the App move that particular chart to the desired
            position.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The other values are dependent on the chart type as described in the
          next section.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How to configure charts using chart types?</summary>
        <p>
          The configuration items that are dependent on the chart type are as
          follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>2x2</b> shows the cross tabulated data for two columns. You can
            select the x and y axes. There is an option of
            <em>average/sum</em> and <em>count if</em> as described in the next
            section.
          </li>
          ,
          <li>
            <b>Data Description</b> describes that input data, i.e. type of
            data, counts, man and min values.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Data Table</b> lists the rows of the input data. You can select
            the number of rows to display.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Date</b> is used when the x-axis has date values. Choose the data
            table chart type date means the x-axis state at the column ID. You
            can select the column to show in the x-axis. Different formats
            available such as DD (day of the month), DDD (day of the week), MMM
            (month), MMM-YY (specific month) and Wx (weeks from report date).
            There is an option of <em>average/sum</em> and <em>count if</em> as
            described in the next section.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>List Count</b> is useful when a column contains a list of values,
            for example list of tags or list of linked defects to a test script.
            You have to indicate a separator for the list, such as comma. The
            separator defaults to a space if not provided. There is an option
            <em>count if</em> as described in the next section.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>List Members</b> is useful when a column contains a list of
            values as described above. The chart shows the count of tags in the
            input. You can further define <em>count if</em> value as described
            in the next section.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Note</b> allows to specify a message in the dashboard. It is not
            a chart but useful in embedding key messages in the dashboard. The
            demos make use of these to describe the charts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Number</b> is used when the x-axis has numbers. There is an
            option for youth enter <em>bin</em> to show chart by bin values. The
            bin if entered must be a comma separated list of numbers in
            ascending order. You can further define <em>count if</em> as
            described in the next section.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Plan</b> shows the data in a Gantt chart The inputs required are
            column that has the description to show in the plan, cowman for
            start date and column for the end date. Columns for start and end
            dates must contain dates. You can further define
            <em>count if</em> as described in the next section.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Risk</b> shows the data in standard 5x5 risk matrix. You can
            select the likelihood and impact columns. The App will expect the
            values 1 to 5 in these columns. You can define the likelihood and
            impact values as well. There are options of <em>average/sum</em> and
            <em>count if</em> as described in the next section.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>State Change</b> is it a chart that shows data on transitions. It
            expects that the data source is sorted in acceding order for each
            item. You have to select the columns from where the App picks the
            values: Time stamp shows the time of the transition while From and
            To give the values at the point of transition. There is an option to
            count the number of transition or calculate the total time of
            transition or average time for transition. There is also an option
            of <code>count if</code> as described in the next section.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>String</b> is a is used when the x-axis is neither Date or
            Number. You can define an <em>order</em> that will make sure (a) the
            x-axis will be ordered accordingly (b) the item will be shown on the
            chart even if the value is zero. For instance, you want to show P1
            even if zero then enter P1 in <em>order</em>. There are options of
            <em>average/sum</em> and <em>count if</em> as described in the next
            section.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Trend</b> shows trend of values; for example, test execution
            trend. You have to specify a date column. You can further define
            <em>count if</em>, <em>plan</em> and <em>forecast</em> values as
            described in the next section.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Trend OC</b> is very similar to Trend except it calculated the
            trend using <em>open</em> and <em>close</em> dates. You can further
            define <em>count if</em>, <em>plan</em> and <em>forecast</em> values
            as described in the next section.

          How to set average/sum, chart filter, plan and forecast?
        </summary>
        <p>
          Following parameters are set using string as an input. To aid your
          input, a template is displayed when the input field is first clicked.
          The templates are explained below (where _x_ is shown in the template,
          a value must be provided).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Average/sum</b> where the App uses another column, called
            <em>column over</em>, that contains numeric data. The App displays
            the sum or average of the values form this second column.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Chart filter</b> has the template
            <code
              >action: exclude|include, column-name: column, op: eq|neq,
              operand: value|[array of values]</code
            >
            The template means either exclude or include records where the
            <code>column-name</code> field contains any item in the array.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Plan</b> has the template
            <code
              >start: date, end: date, scope-from number, scope-to: max|number,
              points: line|sigmoid| [number array]</code
            >
            The app draws that from start to end going form scope-from to scope
            to using the points. The point _arraynum_ a numeric ascending array
            with max value of 1. Examples: [0, 1] draws a straight line. [0, .2,
            1] draws the plan using three values, scope-from at the first point,
            scope-to as the last point and .2 times (scope-to minus scope-from)
            in the middle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Forecast</b> has two templates. For Chart Type as Trend the
            template is
            <code>look-back: number, forecast-to: max|date|number</code>
            The <code>look-back</code> indicates the number of days previous to
            the report date used to calculate forecast,
            <code>forecast-to</code> indicates the end point of the forecast;
            <code>max</code> means date till the maximum value is reached,
            <code>date</code> indicates the end date for the forecast,
            <code>number</code> means a date that is .
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Forecast for Trend OC</b> has the template is
            <code>look-back: number, forecast-to: max|date|number</code>
            The meaning of most parameters are as above except open and close
            that indicate how the forecast is modified.",

        <summary>What are the demos?</summary>
        <p>
          The demos are based on years of experience of successfully delivering
          many types of projects, some $100m in size. The principles learnt from
          this experience is embedded in the demos thereby significantly
          improving the value of these demo dashboards to you.
